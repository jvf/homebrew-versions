# Homebrew Versions

My personal tap to maintain some old versions of formulae.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install jvf/versions/<formula>`

Or `brew tap jvf/versions` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
